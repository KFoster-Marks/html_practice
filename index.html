    <h2>Cities that I've Inhabited</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Colorado Springs, CO<span>&#33</span></h3>
        <p>This is the city in which I was born and raised.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Columbia, MO<span>&#33</span></h3>
        <p>I completed my undergraduate degree at The University of Missouri.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Changwon, South Korea<span>&#33</span></h3>
        <p>I taught English to adorable children at a school here.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Gwangju, South Korea<span>&#33</span></h3>
        <p>I loved Korea so much, that I returned for another year of teaching in a different city.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fort Collins, CO<span>&#33</span></h3>
        <p>I loved teaching, and so combined this with my love of linguistics to complete an M.A. in Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cities that I Want to Visit</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>New York, New York<span>&#63</span></h3>
        <p>Big cities scare me, which is probably why I've yet to visit New York, but I feel like it's something that I should see.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Wellington, New Zealand<span>&#63</span></h3>
        <p>I'm not as interested in this city as I am in the mountains surrounding it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Oslo, Norway<span>&#63</span></h3>
        <p>I've got to see those fjords someday. Oslo would be a great starting point for visiting some of the wilder places in Norway.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
