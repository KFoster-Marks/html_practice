    <h2>Cities that I've Inhabited</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Colorado Springs, CO</h3>
        <p>This is the city in which I was born and raised.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Columbia, MO</h3>
        <p>I completed my undergraduate degree at The University of Missouri.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Changwon, South Korea</h3>
        <p>I taught English to adorable children at a school here.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>I loved Korea so much, that I returned for another year of teaching in a different city.</h3>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fort Collins, CO</h3>
        <p>I loved teaching, and so combined this with my love of linguistics to complete an M.A. in Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cities that I Want to Visit</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>New York</h3>
        <p>Big cities scare me, which is probably why I've yet to visit New York, but I feel like it's something that I should see.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Paris</h3>
        <p>Again, one of those cities that I feel I should see. I'd love to eat some amazing food, and do the Paris marathon as a way to tour the city on foot.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Oslo</h3>
        <p>I've got to see those fjords someday. Oslo would be a great starting point for visiting some of the wilder places in Norway.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
